1. <b>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</b>
The most interesting topic covered would be the introduction of hybrid model between predictive AI and generative AI. It depicted a organic combination of models structure that I have never been thought.

2. <b>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</b>
Ground truth labeling of dataset is harsh, expecially for scraping data. It requires expertise. So I am considering about extending this project to more students with relevant expertise rather than limiting it to our group. This would fully leverage the campus as a hub for knowledge exchange.

3. <b>What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</b>
I think the Quarter 2 Project will most likely be developed on Quarter 1 Project. In my part, I think the data collection process must be optimized, by either spending money on API, or writting a valid script to scrape data from social media video post. 

4. <b>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</b>
Data analyzation visualization, especially for image data, or said binary data. If we could showcase how the video is studied by our model, by visualizing step by step break down analyzation. That would make the project more self-explanatory.
